## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an image recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system will be trained on a labeled dataset of images and will be able to classify new images into predefined categories. The project leverages deep learning algorithms and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training deep learning models.
- Supports various CNN architectures such as VGG, ResNet, and Inception.
- Provides options for data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model performance.
- Includes scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation and model development.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anjali9156/Image-Recognition.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. Experiment with different CNN architectures and model configurations using the provided scripts and notebooks.
3. Train the models on your dataset and evaluate their performance.
4. Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters, adding regularization, or using transfer learning techniques.
5. Deploy the trained model for inference on new images or integrate it into your own applications.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 labeled images of handwritten digits for training and 10,000 images for testing. The dataset is available in the `tf.keras.datasets` module and is automatically downloaded when running the code.

## Model
Several CNN architectures are implemented in the project, including VGGNet, ResNet, and Inception. The models can be easily customized or extended to suit specific image classification tasks. Detailed instructions and examples are provided in the notebooks and scripts. Include information about the layers, activation functions, optimizer, and any other relevant details.

## Results
The project achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with the trained models consistently achieving accuracy scores above 98%. The performance metrics and results are presented in the notebooks and can serve as a baseline for further experimentation and evaluation.
